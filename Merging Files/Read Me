MERGING FILES

1) The "Merge OTU tables" script was used to merge the OTU tables produced from 2016, 2017 and 2018 as detailed in the "Core Analysis" folder
2) The mapping files for each year were also merged using the "Merge Maps" code. 
3) The "Remove Erroneous 2018 Samples" script was used to remove the 2018 samples from the resultant merged OTU table it what was called the "corrected_merged_OTU_table.
      In this script, "ids.txt" refers to a txt file that contained relevant sample IDs to be removed
